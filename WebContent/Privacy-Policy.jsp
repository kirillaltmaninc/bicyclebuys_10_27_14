           <p><span>What Are Cookies?</span></p>
          <p>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. Once you close your browser, we do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer. If you block cookies on your browser privacy settings, you can always place your order by <br>

          <p><span>Information We Use Collected From Cookies</span></p>
          <p>We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.</p>
          <p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you</p>
          <p><span>Sharing Information: </span></p>
          <p>We do not share your information. We do not sell our customer lists to third party advertisers.</p>
          <p><span>Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information:</span></p>
          <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights .
          </p>
          <p>There are instances in which we will share users' personal information as required by Law. </p>
          <p><span>Legal Disclaimer concerning Subpoenas and other matters:</span></p>
          <p>We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: a. comply with the law or with legal process; <br>
            b. protect and defend our rights and property; <br>
            c. protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website <br>
          d. protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</p>
          <p><span>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</span></p>
          <p>When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web site, a secure server encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web site. All orders are processed using SSL, the highest industry standard for encrypting and securing data over the web. We are compliant with the latest industry PCI requirements for processing credit card transactions over the Web. We also limit access to customer information to a select group of personnel who need to fulfill specific jobs (i.e. billing, customer service representativeâ€™s helping you place an order).</p>
          <p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. Please do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email. </p>
          <p><span>How Do We Protect Your Information?</span></p>
          <p>We utilize encryption security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
          <p><span>Information Protection Practices</span></p>
          <p>Our operations and business practices are constantly reviewed for compliance with corporate policies, industry standards and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.</p>
          <p><span>Employee Training and Expectations</span></p>
          <p>We are committed to the protections of our customers information. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are constantly expressed to our staff. </p>
          <p>Our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified on the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Our servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment that is locked and alarmed.</p>
          <p><span>Information Disclosed to Outside Parties Third Party Intermediaries:</span></p>
          <p>We use an outside shipping company (Fedex, USPS, UPS) to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to validate charges for goods. We use an e-mail processor and internet service provider to handle transfer of data over the Web. These companies have agreed with us that they do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>
          <p><span>Breaches of Security</span></p>
          <p>We are not responsible for any breach of security caused by third parties or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. We also may link to other websites or we may allow to be displayed on The Site advertisements of third parties. We are not responsible for such third party's privacy policies or how they treat information about their customers.</p>
          <p><span>Children's Privacy Protection</span></p>
          <p>This site is directed towards those over 18 years of age, not towards children, minors or anyone under the age of 18.</p>
          <p>Please do not send us any information about anyone under the age of 18, like names, addresses or email addresses. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from those under 18, nor do we wish too. In the event of sending a product to a minor, we will do so only with verified parental consent prior to collection. In the case that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><span>Normal Business Transitions</span></p>
          <p>In the event Bicyclebuys.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
